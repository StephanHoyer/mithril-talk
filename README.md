# mithril-talk

I held a talk [@leipzigjs](https://twitter.com/leipzigjs) about [mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril).

[Here](http://slides.com/stephanhoyer/mithril-js#/) are the slides.

As example app, I show how to code TodoMVC with mithril in one hour (cheated).

The code can be found in `example` directory. It has to be improved though.
